This month I have released [PassTheParcel][ptp-source]. PassTheParcel is a simple, quick and easy to use app to play music for "Pass The Parcel" or "Musical Chair" type games.

{% include widgets/image.html src='/images/jekyll/2022-12-01/screen1.PNG' width='150' height='300' title='Screen' %}

Its designed to do a simple task

- Select a music media file from your device's storage
- Optionally select the minimum and maximum length of time to play the music each time the Start button is pressed.
- Start the music - it will automatically stop after a random number of seconds between the limits
- After the music is stopped press start again to play the next section

Benefits

- You can select any music media stored on your device
- As it randomly stops the person using the app can join in the game
- You can take as long as you want to unwrap the parcel as the music will not start again until the start button is pressed 
- There are no adverts

PassTheParcel is available on [Gooogle Play][ptp-play], it can be [side-loaded from the Bitbucket repo][ptp-sideload], as well as [installed from the Amazon Appstore][ptp-amazon].

The [source code][ptp-source] is in Bitbucket.
