This month we have published [PodcastUtilities][podcastutilities-source] on the [Amazon Appstore][amazon-appstore].

We did attempt to distribute it via the Google Play Store however as we needed "Manage Storage" permission Google declined saying "The feature you identified that is dependent on this permission does not appear to be critical to the core functionality of your app", rather than arguing the toss with a Google-bot we decided to publish [PodcastUtilities on Amazon App Store][podcastutilities-amazon] as well as making it available to [sideload][podcastutilities-sideload].

The [source code][podcastutilities-source] is in Github.
