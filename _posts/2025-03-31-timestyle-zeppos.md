Ten years ago I bought a [Pebble Time][pebble-url], and I loved [Dan's wonderful iconic Timestyle][timestyle-site-url] watchface. 5 years later I bought my [a Fitbit Vera][previous-post-1-url] and I could not find a watchface as good as Timestyle so I ported Dan's style and wrote the code again from scratch and released [Timestyle for Fitbit][previous-post-2-url] on the app atore.
