This month I have published [RamEater][rameater-source] on the [Amazon Appstore][amazon-appstore].

RamEater has been available on [Gooogle Play][rameater-play] since 2015, however Google's terms and conditions keep getting more and more stringent and require increasing effort for a free application. So I have decided to widen the available sources where it can be installed from. It can be [side-loaded from the Github repo][rameater-sideload], as well as [installed from the Amazon Appstore][rameater-amazon]

The [source code][rameater-source] is in Github.
